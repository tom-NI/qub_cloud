# Public User Interface

This repository is the "front end" for the entire "Web Word Count" app.
Original code provided (incomplete) to students to be finalized and improved upon.
I added additional JavaScript to both check for a live proxy on a background thread and complete error checking, among other improvements.
Improving aesthetics was not required for this project.
